	<h1>1. Flexbox Use</h1>
	<p>A simple method for use with flexbox has been reated with a number of et beginner features. @mixin flex-box($display, $flex-flow, $justify), the main parametres you would use for this one are "flex, row wrap, space-around". this creates the base most of us start with and it gets more interesting as we go.</p>

	<h1>2. Prefixes</h1>
	<p>Writing out prefixes are a pain in the ass, ideally a number of other tools will already do it. However, whenever you call something that may need a prefix I think this is the cleanest way to take care of them. </p>

	<h1>5. Functions in action in SASS</h1>
	<p>not sure how the fuck I'm doing this but sure we'll find out.</p>
